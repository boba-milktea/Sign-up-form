# Front-end Challenge
My first front-end coding challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) - *Newbie Level*..

## Intro component with sign-up form
#### Branch Name/`Sign-up form`: **completed on July 8, 2022**.
The goal is to build out an intro component and a form with validation.  

#### Challenges 
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

#### Technique and/or tools 
- Client side form validation using Javascript. [Validation Reference](https://dev.to/javascriptacademy/form-validation-using-javascript-34je)
- CSS flexbox/media queries. 

#### To be improved
- The designs were created to two screen widths: 375px(mobile) and 1440px(desktop). It should include the tablet screen size. 
- Using css grid should help with the positions of the text and the form. 
- In order to maintain the style, the validation is hardcorded in JS. However, the Constraint Validation API can be a good tool for it.
